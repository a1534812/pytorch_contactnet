# Pytorch Contact-GraspNet
PyTorch implementation of Contact-GraspNet. Original Tensorflow implementation can be found at: https://github.com/NVlabs/contact_graspnet


DISCLAIMER: This is research code I used as a stepping stone toward a different project - not necessarily intended for use straight out of the box! Your mileage may vary. I'll try and update this repo with my most recent version of the model and better scripts for training, evaluation, and real world soon (read: in the next couple months) but I won't be able to monitor/debug issues that well until then.
